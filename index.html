    <div><h1>My Favourite Hobby is Coding</h1></div> 
<p> My Favourite hobby is Coding because whenever I am free I want to code. Iam 11 years old and I am in 6th class .Because in Coding there is too much of interest and in that we can make what we want there is lot of typing but the fun is more than typing .When we learnt how to code after that we can create various types of games, webpages and most important thing personal websites or websites.We can create utility apps,Native apps and Web apps.In websites or webpages we can create whatever we want like a personal webpage.In personal webpage we have to write information about you. For good looking you can paste the 1 good image of your's and write information about you.Otherwise you can create a webpage (or) website for other people who is well-known.If you are coding you have to try what I had told you'll.

             <br>
             <p>Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. ... Code does that.</p></section>
